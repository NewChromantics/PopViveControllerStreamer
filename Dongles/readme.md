How to flash dongles
============================
The "device name" for tracked objects are watchman's.
Install steamvr.
Plug in dongles.
Find steamvr firmware. 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\tools\lighthouse\firmware\vr_controller\archive`
Find the flashing tool
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\tools\lighthouse\bin\win32\lighthouse_watchman_update.exe`

Running the exe explains how to update, but it's this
`lighthouse_watchman_update.exe -D <pathtofirmware.bin>`
